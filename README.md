# Small World üåç
## A possibly less broken version of Small World

### To be done
- ~~Have client names persist through to the host (and beyond)~~
- Add 3/4/5 player maps
- Finish 2 player map
  - Assign adjascent areas
- Add coins (initial amount, combo picking bonuses, distribute at end of turn)
- ~~Add and persist combo costs when picking~~
- End game screen when final turn has been played
- ~~Fix order of combos when one is chosen~~
- Conquer cost calculations
- Conquer location calculations (i.e. adjascent, tritons, underground, etc.)
- Race interactions
- Power interactions
- In Decline mechanic
- Player turn highlight
- Extra tokens (i.e. dragons, etc.)
- Saving/loading
- Disconnect protection (probs goes hand in hand with saving/loading)

### Possible extras
- Possibly overhaul how tokens are persisted, store all player tokens (in play and otherwise) along with the player (maybe)
